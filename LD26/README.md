My entry for Ludum Dare 26 (Minimalism)


# I'm in

I'm signing up for my first Ludum Dare.

To make it interesting, I've decided to do the whole thing using just my iPad!

I'll be using Javascript with these tools:

<ul>
<li>Library: <a href="http://jawsjs.com">JawsJs</a></li>
<li>IDE: <a href="http://www.textasticapp.com/">Textastic</a></li>
<li>Graphics: <a href="http://terriblegames.com/spriteSomething/">Sprite Something</a></li>
<li>Sound: <a href="http://www.warmplace.ru/soft/pixitracker/">PixiTracker</a></li>
</ul>

I also might use a simple touch-based control pad I made a while ago, code for which is <a href="https://github.com/MalphasWats/Quint">on GitHub</a>

I've set my iPad up to mirror to my iMac so I can take screenshots for a time lapse that I'll post at the end!


# Minimalism
"The Minimalist" art crime story. Bryan is an Artist, he likes to keep his work simple, in fact, critics have hailed him as one of the greatest living Minimalists.

No longer a crime story. Bryan works as an Artist and must create works of minimalist art on demand, trying to make enough cash to live.


#Grrr,

I had my iMac set to require password after it went to sleep so I missed the first hour of work that I did!


#update!

I had some trouble with my mirroring at the start, so i missed off the first hour of work for my time lapse, which was disappointing.

My idea took a little while to work itself out in my head, but i think I'm making some progress now. Here's what "The Minimalist" looks like so far:

# To Bed!

Fairly happy with the progress I've made today, I think I actually have a chance of finishing. A little worried about the actual challenge of the game, but hopefully I can tweak that towards the end, still got a lot left to do!

So far, the whole thing has been done entirely on my iPad, all the art, all the coding, everything. It was slower going at first, but I'm getting faster now and I'm probably not far off the sort of pace I would have made on my iMac really - with one two-year-old and one two-week-old in the house, I don't really get to concentrate for extended periods of time anyway!!
